# My First Shiny App

This repository contains the source code for and exercise I did with the only purpose to learn how to do a basic 
Shiny application in R. 

(please note that I haven't quality assured the data, for duplicates, missing hospital codes, hospitals that may have changed their code over time, aggregates, etc
as I only needed to understand the structure of an app.R script and how to deploy the application on the R server)

You can view the live app here: [My Shiny App on shinyapps.io](https://ht3bw7-inma-ruiz.shinyapps.io/Births_Scotland/)
